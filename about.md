### About
I'm a first-year master's student in the Machine Learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, and my advisor is [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/). I'm interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, specifically in how to improve communication between computers and humans (semantic parsing, question answering) or between humans with the help of computers (machine translation). In my free time I lead [Puzzlehunt@CMU](http://puzzlehunt.club/), a puzzling club.

### Projects and Publications

I don't have a lot of publications yet, but here are some things I've worked on:

 - Generating Code from Natural Language 
 - Natural Language Inference on MultiNLI with Paul Michel [https://github.com/EggyLv999/MultiNLIStacked]
 - IJCAI 2017 Workshop: Getting your Fare Share: Joint work with Omer Lev, Ariel Procaccia, Xinyu Wu, Yair Zick, ([pdf](http://agt2017.net.technion.ac.il/files/2017/07/AGTIJCAI2017_paper_8_ChenLPWZ.pdf))
